## Building

Open the *Build Settings* dialog in Unity, select the Universal Web Platform environment, click the *Add open scenes* button, and then select *Build*. This will build a UWP visual studio solution in your selected folder. Once Unity completes building, open the new VS solution, and build the Master version of this solution and deploy to your HoloLens device. 

**NOTE:** Ensure *Virtual Reality Supported* is checked under *Player Settings > XR Settings* as well as the *InternetClient*, *InternetClientServer*, and *PrivateNetworkClientServer* capabilities are checked under *Player Settings > Publishing Settings > Capabilities*.
